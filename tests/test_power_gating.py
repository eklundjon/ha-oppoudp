"""Regression tests for the power-off UI bounce (off -> on -> off).

Root cause: after a POF the player emits a stale power ON (a late QPW reply to
a query issued before the command), and the old handler flipped state back to
ON *and* kicked off a ~15-query re-sync, stretching the bounce to ~4s.

The fix is command-generation gating in the device: the last commanded/pushed
power state is authoritative; a *solicited* reply (OppoPowerResponse) that
contradicts it is dropped as stale, while an *unsolicited* push (UPW ->
OppoUpdatePowerStatusResponse) is a genuine change and is always honored.
